## Front end made with React, Redux Toolkit, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Backend made with Express and SQLite. 

As a fun side project, I wanted to create a music application in React for the sole purpose of hosting my own music. This project was an awesome learning experience for me as it was my first time using tools like Redux to manage state, and also using RESTful api calls to manage the music database. If you like what you see, give the project a star, I will be iterating overtime to make it more customizable for other artists to make their own!
